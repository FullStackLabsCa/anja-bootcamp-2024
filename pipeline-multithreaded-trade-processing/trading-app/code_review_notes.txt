- working with (properly named) interfaces 
- good package names and layers should be honored
- we don't want to initialize repo and service classes everytime
- we don't want to initialize database connections, transactions, queue connection factory/connection/channel repeatedly
- not everything will be mvc pattern - we draw out the architecture 
and then our packages will reflect the layers accordingly '
- entity package contains your entities being CRUD'ed into/from the DB
- Enums are used for logically grouping your constant values

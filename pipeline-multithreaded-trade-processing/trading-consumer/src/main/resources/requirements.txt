When tradeProcessor receives a tradeId from the Queue, 
    - then it should fetch the trade details from the trade repository
        - if the cusip is found in the securityReferenceLookup
            - then it should insert the journalEntry in the journal repository
            - then it should upsert the position in the Positions table 
            - then it should update the trade status in the trade repository
        - else it should log the error


based on this --- 
can you give me the list of test cases - 
        positive, and negative --
